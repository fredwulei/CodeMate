# CodeMate

## Desc

CodeMate is a real-time code sharing tool. It is designed for working coding problems together. On the top-left panel, you can write code with nice syntax highlighting and auto complementation. On the bottom-left panel, you can get the output and check if your code works in the console. The top-right panel is the place you paste your problem, and the bottom-right one is where you and your codemates communicate. This project uses node.js server with socket.io library to achieve high proformance, and embeds ACE editor on the front side.
